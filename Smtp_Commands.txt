SMTP Commands or Requests:

HELO/EHLO: Initiates the SMTP session conversation. The client greets the server and introduces itself. Use HELO followed by the domain name or IP address of the SMTP client. Example: HELO client.net or EHLO client.net (for servers supporting ESMTP).
MAIL FROM: Starts a mail transfer. Specify the sender mailbox (reverse-path). Optional parameters can be added. Example: MAIL FROM "test@client.net"
RCPT TO: Specifies the recipient. Use RCPT TO followed by the destination mailbox (forward-path). For multiple recipients, use this command separately for each recipient. Example: RCPT TO "user@recipient.net"
DATA: Asks the server for permission to transfer mail data. The response code 354 grants permission, and the client sends the email contents line by line. Terminate with a period (.). Example:
